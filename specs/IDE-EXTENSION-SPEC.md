# `ide-extension` — Napper IDE Extension Specification

> The extension is the **primary entry point** for most users. It must be as approachable as Postman on first open, but backed by plain files that work perfectly from the CLI and in CI.

---

## Target IDEs

| IDE | Language | Grammar System | Status |
|-----|----------|---------------|--------|
| **VSCode** (+ Cursor, Windsurf, VSCodium) | TypeScript | TextMate | Primary |
| **Zed** | Rust → WASM | Tree-sitter | Primary |
| **Neovim** | Lua | Tree-sitter | Future |

All extensions shell out to the **Nap CLI** for execution. No IDE extension re-implements the HTTP runner. This keeps every IDE in sync with the CLI.

## `vscode-philosophy` — Design Philosophy

- **No separate app.** Everything lives inside the IDE. No webview-based fake browser.
- **Files are always the truth.** The UI is a lens over `.nap` and `.naplist` files. Edits in the UI update the file directly; edits in the file are immediately reflected in the UI. There is no sync step.
- **Progressive disclosure.** A new user can send their first request within 30 seconds of installing. Advanced features (scripting, playlists, environments) reveal themselves naturally as the user explores.
- **Looks good, works fast.** The UI should feel polished — not a dev tool hacked together from tree views and JSON editors.
- **Parity where possible.** Features should be as close as possible across IDEs. Where an IDE lacks a capability, degrade gracefully rather than omit the feature entirely.

---

## `ide-lsp` — Portable Core: Nap Language Server (LSP)

The foundation for cross-IDE feature parity is a **Nap Language Server** (`napper-lsp`) — an F# binary that speaks LSP 3.17 over stdio. It reuses `Napper.Core` directly (parser, types, environment) with zero duplicated logic.

**The LSP replaces duplicated logic in IDE extensions.** The VSIX currently re-parses `.nap` files in TypeScript to extract HTTP methods, URLs, playlist steps, and environment names. This logic already exists in `Napper.Core` F#. After the LSP cutover, all IDEs ask the LSP for this data instead of reimplementing parsing in their own language. **Less TypeScript, less Rust, MORE F#.**

IDE extensions become **thin UI shells** — they render data from the LSP and handle IDE-specific UI (CodeLens, tree views, status bars). They do NOT parse `.nap` files themselves.

See **[LSP Specification](./LSP-SPEC.md)** for the full capability spec and **[LSP Plan](./LSP-PLAN.md)** for implementation phases.

## Shared Behaviour (All IDEs)

### `vscode-syntax` — Syntax Highlighting

Full grammar-aware highlighting for `.nap` and `.naplist` files. Both grammars must produce visually identical results.

**VSCode:** TextMate grammar (`.tmLanguage.json`).
**Zed:** Tree-sitter grammar with `highlights.scm`, `brackets.scm`, `outline.scm`, `indents.scm` query files.

Both grammars highlight:
- Section headers (`[meta]`, `[request]`, `[assert]`, `[script]`, `[vars]`, `[steps]`)
- Keys and values
- `{{variable}}` interpolation
- HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, etc.)
- Comments (`#`)
- String literals
- Assertion operators (`exists`, `matches`, `contains`, `<`, `=`)

### `vscode-codelens` — Run Actions

Every IDE must support running a `.nap` file or `.naplist` file from within the editor.

**VSCode:** CodeLens actions appear above relevant lines:
- `▶ Run` above `[request]`
- `▶ Run Playlist` above `[meta]` in `.naplist` files
- `⧉ Copy as curl` above `[request]`

**Zed:** Runnables via `runnables.scm` detect `[request]` blocks and offer "Run" in the editor gutter. The runnable executes `nap run <file>` and streams output to the terminal.

### Language Intelligence (via LSP)

All IDEs connect to the Nap Language Server (`nap-lsp`) for completions, diagnostics, hover, and document symbols. See **[LSP Specification](./LSP-SPEC.md)** for the full details.

---

## VSCode-Only Features

These features rely on VSCode APIs that have no equivalent in Zed or Neovim.

### `vscode-layout` — Layout Overview

The extension contributes a dedicated **Nap Activity Bar icon** (sidebar panel). The panel has two tabs:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Nap                  [+ v] │  <- panel header: new request button, env picker
├──────────┬──────────────────┤
│ Explorer │ Playlists        │  <- two tabs
├──────────┴──────────────────┤
│                             │
│  my-api/                    │  <- folder = collection
│    auth/                    │
│      01_login               │  <- .nap file
│      02_refresh-token       │
│    users/                   │
│      01_get-user       pass │  <- pass indicator
│      02_create-user    fail │  <- fail indicator
│      03_delete-user         │
│                             │
│  smoke            [> Run]   │  <- .naplist file
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### `vscode-explorer` — Explorer Tab

The Explorer tab mirrors the folder structure on disk, filtered to `.nap`, `.naplist`, and `.napenv` files.

**Each `.nap` file node shows:**
- File name (without extension, prettified)
- HTTP method badge (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) in a colour-coded pill
- Last run result icon: pass / fail / pending / skipped
- Hover: URL, last run time, last status code

**Context menu on a `.nap` file:**
- Run
- Copy as curl
- Open in editor
- Add to playlist
- Duplicate
- Delete

**Folder (collection) context menu:**
- Run all
- New request here
- New playlist here

### `vscode-playlists` — Playlists Tab

Lists all `.naplist` files found in the workspace, with a tree showing their step structure (including nested playlists). Each playlist node has a Run button. Individual steps can be run in isolation.

### `vscode-editor` — Request Editor (split view)

Clicking a `.nap` file opens it in a **split editor**: the raw `.nap` file on the left (editable), and a structured **Request Panel** on the right as a webview.

```
┌─────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  get-user.nap           │  Get user by ID              [> Run] │
│─────────────────────────│──────────────────────────────────────│
│ [meta]                  │  -- Request ----------------------  │
│ name = "Get user by ID" │  GET  https://api.ex.../users/42    │
│                         │                                      │
│ [request]               │  Headers                         [+] │
│ method = GET            │  Authorization  Bearer ******        │
│ url = {{baseUrl}}/...   │  Accept         application/...      │
│                         │  ----------------------------------- │
│ [assert]                │                                      │
│ status = 200            │  -- Response ---------------------   │
│ body.id exists          │  200 OK   47ms   1.2 KB              │
│                         │                                      │
│                         │  Headers   Body   Preview            │
│                         │  {                                   │
│                         │    "id": "42",                       │
│                         │    "name": "Alice"                   │
│                         │  }                                   │
│                         │                                      │
│                         │  Assertions                          │
│                         │  pass status = 200                   │
│                         │  pass body.id exists                 │
└─────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The right panel is read-only** — a live preview of the request and (after running) the response. All editing is done in the `.nap` file on the left. The two sides stay in sync automatically.

**Response sub-tabs:**
- **Body** — raw or pretty-printed JSON/XML/text with syntax highlighting and search
- **Headers** — response headers as a clean key/value table
- **Preview** — rendered HTML (for HTML responses) or image (for image responses)

**Assertions section** (below the response): each assertion from the `[assert]` block is listed with its pass/fail state and the actual vs. expected value on failure.

### `vscode-env-switcher` — Environment Switcher

A **status bar item** (bottom-left) shows the active environment:

```
[ Nap: staging v ]
```

Clicking opens a quick-pick dropdown listing all detected environments (from `.napenv.*` files). Switching environment immediately re-resolves all variable previews in open editors.

A per-workspace setting `nap.defaultEnvironment` can be committed to the repo to set the team default.

### `vscode-new-request` — New Request Flow

Clicking **[+]** in the panel header (or running the `Nap: New Request` command) opens a guided quick-input flow:

1. **Pick HTTP method** — GET / POST / PUT / PATCH / DELETE / HEAD / OPTIONS
2. **Enter URL** — with autocomplete for `{{baseUrl}}` and other known variables
3. **Pick destination folder** — from the workspace collection tree
4. **Name the request** — defaults to `{method} {path}` (e.g. `GET users-userId`)

The file is created immediately and opened in the split editor, ready to run.

### `vscode-test-explorer` — Test Explorer Integration

The extension registers a `vscode.TestController` so all `.nap` files appear in the standard VSCode **Test Explorer** panel (the flask icon in the activity bar).

- Collections map to **test suites**
- `.nap` files map to **test items**
- `.naplist` files map to a **test suite** with each step as a child item
- Nested playlists are nested suites

Run/debug actions in the Test Explorer invoke the Nap CLI under the hood (`nap run <file> --output junit`) and map results back to the test items.

Results are shown in the **Test Results** output panel with:
- Full request (method, URL, headers, body)
- Full response (status, headers, body)
- Each assertion result with actual vs. expected values on failure
- Script output (`ctx.Log` messages) shown as test output

---

## Zed-Only Features

### Runnables

Zed's `runnables.scm` detects `[request]` blocks in `.nap` files and offers a gutter "Run" action. The runnable executes `nap run <file>` and streams output to the Zed terminal panel. Environment variables from `runnables.scm` captures (prefixed `ZED_CUSTOM_`) can pass context.

### Slash Commands (Assistant Integration)

Zed extensions can register slash commands for the Zed Assistant:

- `/nap-run <file>` — run a `.nap` file and return the result in the Assistant context
- `/nap-import-openapi <file>` — generate `.nap` files from an OpenAPI spec

### Text Redactions

Zed supports `redactions.scm` to mask sensitive values during screen sharing. The Nap grammar should redact `{{variable}}` values sourced from `.napenv.local`.

---

## `vscode-settings` — Extension Settings

These settings apply across all IDEs where the extension supports configuration.

| Setting | Default | Description | IDEs |
|---------|---------|-------------|------|
| `nap.defaultEnvironment` | `""` | Active environment name | All (VSCode via settings, Zed/Neovim via CLI flag) |
| `nap.autoRunOnSave` | `false` | Re-run the request when the file is saved | VSCode |
| `nap.splitEditorLayout` | `"beside"` | `"beside"` or `"below"` for the response panel | VSCode |
| `nap.maskSecretsInPreview` | `true` | Mask variables sourced from `.napenv.local` in hover tooltips | All (via LSP) |
| `nap.cliPath` | `"nap"` | Path to the Nap CLI binary (auto-detected if on PATH) | All |

---

## `vscode-commands` — Extension Commands

### VSCode (Command Palette)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Nap: New Request` | Create a new `.nap` file via guided flow |
| `Nap: New Playlist` | Create a new `.naplist` file |
| `Nap: Run File` | Run the currently open `.nap` or `.naplist` |
| `Nap: Run All` | Run all `.nap` files in the workspace |
| `Nap: Switch Environment` | Open environment picker |
| `Nap: Copy as curl` | Copy the current request as a curl command |
| `Nap: Generate from OpenAPI` | Run `nap generate openapi` against a spec file |
| `Nap: Reveal in Explorer` | Jump from the Nap panel to the file in the native Explorer |

### Zed (Slash Commands)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/nap-run` | Run a `.nap` file and return results in Assistant |
| `/nap-import-openapi` | Generate `.nap` files from an OpenAPI spec |

## `vscode-impl` — Implementation Notes

### VSCode

- Built in **TypeScript** using the VSCode Extension API.
- The response panel webview uses a minimal framework (Lit or vanilla TS + CSS) — no heavy UI library.
- The extension shells out to the **Nap CLI** (`nap run --output json`) for all HTTP execution.
- **CLI acquisition:** The VSIX installs the CLI via `dotnet tool install -g napper --version X.X.X` on activation, where `X.X.X` is the extension's own `package.json` version. This avoids raw binary downloads (which trigger Windows SmartScreen warnings on unsigned binaries) and leverages NuGet as a trusted distribution channel. If the CLI is already on PATH at the correct version, installation is skipped.
- File watching via `vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher` keeps the panel tree up to date without polling.
- The `.nap` language grammar (TextMate `.tmLanguage.json`) is generated from the ANTLR grammar to avoid drift.
- Published to the **VS Code Marketplace** and the **Open VSX Registry** (for VSCodium / Cursor / Windsurf users).

### Zed

- Built in **Rust**, compiled to **WebAssembly** via `zed_extension_api` crate.
- Tree-sitter grammar for `.nap` and `.naplist` (separate from the TextMate grammar — tree-sitter is more expressive for structural queries).
- LSP integration: the extension declares the Nap Language Server in `extension.toml` and implements `language_server_command` to launch it.
- Published via the **zed-industries/extensions** GitHub repository.
- No webviews, no sidebar panels, no test explorer — these are VSCode-only. Zed users get syntax highlighting, LSP intelligence, and runnables.

### Shared

- All extensions shell out to `nap run` for execution. No IDE re-implements HTTP logic.
- All extensions connect to `nap-lsp` for language intelligence. See **[LSP Specification](./LSP-SPEC.md)**.
- Grammar definitions (TextMate and Tree-sitter) are both derived from the same ANTLR `.g4` grammar to prevent drift.
