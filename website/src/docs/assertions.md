# Assertions (spec: nap-assert)

The `[assert]` section in `.nap` files provides declarative assertions on HTTP responses. No scripting needed for common checks.

## Syntax

Each assertion is a single line in the form:

```
target operator value
```

## Status code (spec: assert-status)

```
[assert]
status = 200
```

## JSON body paths (spec: assert-equals, assert-exists, assert-gt)

Assert on values in the JSON response body using dot notation:

```
[assert]
body.id = 1
body.name = "Ada Lovelace"
body.email exists
body.users.length > 0
```

## Headers (spec: assert-contains, assert-exists)

Check response headers:

```
[assert]
headers.Content-Type contains "application/json"
headers.X-Request-Id exists
```

## Response time (spec: assert-lt)

Assert that the response completes within a time limit:

```
[assert]
duration < 500ms
duration < 2s
```

## Operators

| Operator | Description | Example | Spec |
|----------|-------------|---------|------|
| `=` | Equals | `status = 200` | (spec: assert-equals) |
| `>` | Greater than | `body.count > 0` | (spec: assert-gt) |
| `<` | Less than | `duration < 500ms` | (spec: assert-lt) |
| `exists` | Field is present | `body.id exists` | (spec: assert-exists) |
| `contains` | String contains | `headers.Content-Type contains "json"` | (spec: assert-contains) |
| `matches` | Regex match | `body.email matches "^.+@.+$"` | (spec: assert-matches) |

## Multiple assertions

Add as many assertions as you need:

```
[assert]
status = 200
body.id exists
body.name = "Ada Lovelace"
body.email contains "@"
headers.Content-Type contains "application/json"
duration < 1000ms
```

All assertions are evaluated. Napper reports each one as passed or failed.

## Complex assertions with scripts

For assertions that go beyond the declarative syntax, use [F#](/docs/fsharp-scripting/) or [C#](/docs/csharp-scripting/) post-request scripts:

```
[script]
post = ./scripts/validate-schema.fsx
```

```fsharp
// validate-schema.fsx
let users = ctx.Response.Json.EnumerateArray() |> Seq.toList

for user in users do
    if not (user.TryGetProperty("email") |> fst) then
        ctx.Fail $"User {user.GetProperty("id")} missing email"
```
