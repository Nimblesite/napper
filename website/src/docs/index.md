# Introduction

**Napper** is a free, open-source, CLI-first API testing tool that integrates natively with VS Code. It is a modern alternative to Postman, Bruno, `.http` files, and curl.

Napper is built for developers who want:

- **Simple things to be simple** — a one-off request is nearly as terse as curl (spec: nap-minimal)
- **Complex things to be possible** — full F# and C# scripting for advanced flows (spec: script-fsx, script-csx)
- **Everything in version control** — plain text files, no binary blobs (spec: nap-file, naplist-file, env-file)
- **First-class VS Code support** — syntax highlighting, Test Explorer, environment switching
- **Easy migration** — convert existing `.http` files with a single CLI command (spec: cli-convert)

## How does Napper work?

Every HTTP request is a `.nap` file (spec: nap-file):

```
GET https://api.example.com/health
```

That's it. One line. Run it from the CLI:

```bash
napper run ./health.nap
```

Or from VS Code with a single click.

## What happens when you need more?

Add headers, bodies, assertions, and environment variables (spec: nap-full):

```
[meta]
name = Create user

[request]
POST {{baseUrl}}/users

[request.headers]
Content-Type = application/json
Authorization = Bearer {{token}}

[request.body]
"""
{
  "name": "Ada Lovelace",
  "email": "ada@example.com"
}
"""

[assert]
status = 201
body.id exists
duration < 500ms
```

Chain requests into test suites with `.naplist` files (spec: naplist-file). Add F# or C# scripts for advanced orchestration (spec: script-fsx, script-csx). Output JUnit XML for your CI pipeline (spec: output-junit).

## Already using .http files? (spec: cli-convert)

Napper includes a built-in converter to migrate your existing `.http` files. Both Microsoft (VS Code REST Client) and JetBrains (IntelliJ, Rider, WebStorm) dialects are supported:

```bash
napper convert http ./requests.http
```

The converter maps variables to `.napenv` files, preserves request names, and converts JetBrains `http-client.env.json` environments. See the [.http file comparison](/docs/vs-http-files/) for details.

## Why is the CLI the primary interface?

Napper is not a GUI-first tool with a CLI bolted on. The CLI is the primary interface. The VS Code extension operates on the same files and provides the same features in your editor. This means your API tests work the same way locally and in CI/CD, with no import/export step.
