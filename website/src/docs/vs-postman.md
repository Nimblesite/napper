# Napper vs Postman (spec: cli-run, nap-file)

Napper is a free, open-source, CLI-first alternative to Postman for API testing. Here is how they compare.

## What is the main difference between Napper and Postman?

Postman is a GUI-first application with a standalone desktop client. The command line interface (Newman) is a secondary tool. Napper takes the opposite approach: the CLI is the primary product, and the VS Code extension provides a visual interface within your existing editor.

## Does Napper require an account?

No. Napper requires no account, no sign-up, and no cloud sync. Postman requires an account to use the desktop application and locks collaboration features, advanced scripting, and API monitoring behind paid tiers.

## How do file formats compare? (spec: nap-file)

Postman stores collections as JSON blobs that are difficult to read in diffs and code reviews. Napper stores every request as a plain text `.nap` file, every test suite as a `.naplist` file, and every environment as a `.napenv` file. All formats are human-readable and produce clean git diffs.

## How does scripting compare? (spec: script-fsx, script-csx)

Postman provides a sandboxed JavaScript environment with a limited set of built-in libraries. Napper supports both F# (`.fsx`) and C# (`.csx`) scripts with full access to the .NET ecosystem. You can parse XML, call databases, generate cryptographic tokens, validate JSON schemas, and reference any NuGet package.

## How does CI/CD integration compare? (spec: cli-run, cli-output)

Postman requires Newman (a separate npm package) for running collections from the command line. Napper is CLI-first with a self-contained binary and no runtime dependencies. It outputs JUnit XML, JSON, and NDJSON formats natively.

## Feature comparison

| Feature | Napper | Postman |
|---------|--------|---------|
| CLI-first design | Yes | No (Newman is secondary) |
| VS Code integration | Native extension | Separate app |
| Git-friendly files | Plain text `.nap` files | JSON blobs |
| Assertions | Declarative + F#/C# scripts | JavaScript scripts |
| Scripting | Full F# and C# with .NET access | Sandboxed JavaScript |
| CI/CD output | JUnit, JSON, NDJSON | Via Newman |
| Test Explorer | Native VS Code support | No |
| Account required | No | Yes |
| .http file migration | Built-in converter | Import only |
| Pricing | Free, MIT license | Freemium with paid tiers |

## When should you choose Napper over Postman?

Choose Napper if you want a tool that lives in your terminal and editor, stores everything as plain text in your repository, runs natively in CI/CD without additional dependencies, and gives you the full power of F# and C# for advanced scripting. Choose Postman if you need a standalone GUI application with built-in collaboration features and cloud-based team workspaces.
